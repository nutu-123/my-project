This project creates a basic admin dashboard layout using HTML and CSS.
It includes a dark mode toggle, a sidebar with links, a main content area, and a footer. 
It uses CSS Grid for layout and CSS variables for easy theme switching.

HTML (structure of the webpage):
1. Header (<header>)
Shows the title "Admin Dashboard"
Contains a checkbox to toggle Dark Mode

2. Sidebar (<div id="sidebar">)
Lists 3 links: Home, Users, and Settings
Each link is blue, underlined, and clickable (via <a>)

3. Main Section (<main>)
Displays a welcome message and space for content like charts or tables

4. Footer (<footer>)
Shows copyright

5. Script
Adds a click event to the checkbox that toggles dark mode by adding/removing the dark class on <body>

CSS (complete styling):
1. Color Themes with Variables
Uses :root for default (light) colors
Uses .dark class for dark mode colors (like dark backgrounds and light text)

2. Layout
Uses CSS Grid to arrange header, sidebar, main, and footer areas
Makes sure layout fills the full screen height (height: 100vh)

3.Header
Green background, white text
Aligns title and toggle on the same line

4. Sidebar
Light grey in light mode, dark grey in dark mode
Bulleted list with blue underlined links (light blue in dark mode)

5. Main Content
Simple padding for clean spacing

6. Footer
Green background (should be same as header)
White centered text
