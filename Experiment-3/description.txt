This is a simple Admin Dashboard webpage made using HTML and CSS. 
It has a header with a title and a dark mode toggle switch, a sidebar with clickable blue underlined links (Home, Users, Settings), a main area with a welcome message, and a footer. 
The layout is created using CSS Grid, and the colors change when dark mode is turned on using a checkbox. 
JavaScript is used to switch between light and dark themes. 
The sidebar links are shown in bullet points and are styled to look like real navigation links.

Test cases:
1.When you open the page, it shows the light theme by default.
2.Clicking the dark mode checkbox changes the background and text to dark theme colors.
3.The sidebar links are clickable and styled properly.
4.The layout stays neat even when you resize the window.
