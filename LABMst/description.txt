We have created a simple Movie collection UI which shows the movie details in the form of cards.
Movie details include title of the movie, genre and the ratings.
After this each card has a remove button which removes that particular movie.
This remove button when clicked calls a function removeMovie().
And then the movie is removed from the list.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Learnt how to create a react app
2. Learnt how to render elements in the form of cards.
3. Learnt about the components in react and its uses.
