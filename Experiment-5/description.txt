This project creates a basic Product Filter system using HTML and JavaScript.
It allows users to add products with details like ID, Name, Price and Category and then filter them by category using a dropdown menu.
Using JavaScript categories are automatically updated based on user input.


HTML (BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE WEBPAGE):
We first created a <div> with class "container" inside the <body> tag, which contains all sections of the project.
1.Product Details Section
Heading(<h2>): "Enter Product Details"
Four input fields created with <input> tags for:
Product ID
Product Name
Product Price
Product Category
A button with the text "Add Product" that calls addProduct() function on click (<button>)

2.Category Filter Section
Heading(<h2>): "Filter by Category"
A <select> dropdown with id "categoryDropdown" that updates categories
Includes a default option using <option> "All" to show every product which is listed

3.Product List Section
Heading: "Product List"
A <div> with id "productList" where products will be displayed dynamically


JAVASCRIPT (FUNCTIONALITY):
1. Function 1: Adding Products (addProduct())
Reads input values (ID, Name, Price, Category)
Validates that no field is empty
Creates a JSON object for the product and pushes it to the products[] array
Updates category dropdown and product list dynamically
Clears input fields after successful addition
Updating Category Dropdown (updateCategoryDropdown())
Extracts unique categories from products[]
Refreshes the dropdown with new categories
Always keeps "All" option at the top

2. Function 2: Filtering Products (filterProducts())
Displays only products belonging to the selected category
If "All" is selected, groups products by category
Handles cases where no products are added or no product exists in a selected category

3. Function 3: Clear Inputs (clearInputs())
Resets all input fields after adding a product

4. Initialization
Calls filterProducts() on page load to show "No products added yet."


LEARNING OUTCOMES:
I learnt how to change and update the webpage content using JavaScript.
I understood how to save product details in a list as objects.
I learnt how to show products category-wise and filter them easily.
I understood how to make a system where the webpage updates automatically without reloading.
